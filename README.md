Sentiment Analysis of Flipkart Customer Reviews

Problem Identification:

Flipkart, being one of the largest e-commerce platforms, collects a huge amount of customer feedback in the form of product reviews. Manually analyzing this feedback to understand customer sentiments is a challenging and time-consuming task. Businesses need a scalable solution to automatically assess customer satisfaction and improve their services or products based on this feedback.

Solution:

I developed a Sentiment Analysis model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to classify Flipkart customer reviews into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

Using Logistic Regression and Na√Øve Bayes for classification, the model achieved 80% accuracy. 

This solution provides valuable insights from customer feedback, helping businesses and sellers on Flipkart make data-driven decisions to enhance their products and services.
